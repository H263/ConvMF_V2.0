This is an updation of [ConvMF](http://dm.postech.ac.kr/~cartopy/ConvMF/)

Because of that keras has updated from 1.0 to 2.0, So I update the core code in ConvMF. You can use the run_test.sh to test code in your environment after you download the code.

If you have any question, don't hestitate to contact with me.
